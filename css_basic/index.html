        <h1>Do Aliens Exist?</h1>
        <h2>We might not be ALONE.</h2>
        <p>
          Children tend to be taught that they are special and unique. But as
          people grow, we realise that people have a lot in common and it might
          not be a stretch that someone once existed that made the same choices
          as you have. As individuals we might understand that we are not unique
          and speacial, but as a collective, this is far from the case. People
          are skeptical that there are other intelligent lifeforms outside of
          our solar-system.
        </p>

        <h3>The meat of the matter</h3>
        <p>
          The lack of evidence of other intelligent lifeform alone does not
          explain why people express skeptisism towards this idea. People
          believe many things that do not have evidence supporting them. In my
          opinion, it is a choice to believe that we are the only intelligent
          lifeform that exists. A choice that may be conscious of subconscious
          but nevertheless one that comes from the thought that we are special
          and unique.

        <h3>The bigger picture</h3>
        <p>
          Believing we are the only intelligent beings in the universe often
          reflects a deep-seated need to place ourselves at the center of
          existence. For centuries, human civilizations have constructed
          narratives where Earth, and by extension humanity, is the focal point
          of creation. The geocentric view of the universe persisted until
          science debunked it, and even now, traces of this egocentrism linger
          in how we approach the cosmos. This perspective can make the idea of
          sharing the universe with other intelligent beings uncomfortable, as
          it challenges humanity's perceived uniqueness and dominance.
        </p>
        <h3>Possibilities Beyond</h3>
        <p>
          Yet, as science progresses, the vastness of the universe increasingly
          suggests otherwise. With billions of galaxies, each containing
          billions of stars and potentially trillions of planets, the odds of
          Earth being the only cradle of intelligent life seem astronomically
          low. Discoveries of exoplanets in habitable zones, extremophiles
          thriving in harsh environments, and the building blocks of life found
          on comets push us to reconsider our place in the cosmos. Skepticism
          may persist, but it is worth questioning whether it's rooted in a lack
          of evidence or in our unwillingness to relinquish the comforting
          notion of human exceptionalism.
